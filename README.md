### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name Bima Prastyaji, and I have a strong interest in Machine Learning, particularly in the areas of Signal Processing and Music Technology. My focus lies in exploring how machine learning algorithms can be applied to understand, analyze, and manipulate audio signals â€” both in musical and general audio contexts.
